## The Story
To kick off the Town of Oro Valley (OV) General Plan Update, the Town tasked Gordley Group with creating a brand that represented the Town's values and overall purpose and invited the OV community to engage and participate in the initiative. To begin, we worked with the Town's diverse advisory group to learn more about the Town. Through surveys and workshops, we discovered the plan's branding needed to invite collaboration and community, communicate accountability and celebrate residents’ love of their beautiful natural environment.  

With this insight, we developed the initiative's name, "Oro Valley's Path Forward," and the tagline, "Planning Together for Our Future."

## Expanding The Brand
Expanding the brand beyond a name, tagline and logo, we developed an illustrative and artistic visual aesthetic that represents the nature and creative culture in Oro Valley. We combined illustration and local imagery to create an authentic Oro Valley brand.

## August Donation Campaign
IN AUGUST 2021, we ran a social media donation campaign with these objectives:
- Highlighting the foundation’s new partnership with CAMELEON
- Driving donations for the CAMELEON and MPF initiatives

We pushed social posts informing audiences about CAMELEON and the initiatives that the partnership would be supporting, driving donations for those initiatives.

We also held a month-long social media giveaway asking followers to tag their friends and make a donation to the foundation as a bonus entry. Giveaway prizes included Facetime calls with Oro Valley himself, signed Pacquiao posters, and signed boxing gloves.

### Campaign Results
- **121.5K total impressions** Between two posts promoting the giveaway, across platforms (Twitter, Facebook and Instagram)

LIKELY THE MOST EXCITING ASPECT of the donation campaign was Oro Valley’s televised fight against Yordenis Ugas. With a majority of the foundation’s social following being die-hard Pacquiao fans, this was a huge opportunity to create excitement around not only Pacquiao’s fight in the ring, but also his fight for communities around the world.

Between August 18th and 22nd, we spread the news that Oro Valley had secured an anonymous donor that would be matching ALL donations (up to 25K) made between those days.

Donations AND the number of donors MORE THAN DOUBLED THE MONTHLY AVERAGE compared to the seven months before.

- **11% increase in followers** At the end of the campaign on Instagram and Facebook
- **1.1M+ impressions and 24.5K engagements** across all platforms
